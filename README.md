# Dicrimination-and-learning-of-temporal-input-sequences-in-a-cerebellar-Purkinje-cell-model

These programs were used in the article "Discrimination and learning of temporal input sequences in a cerebellar Purkinje cell model". 

In this research, I modified part of the cerebellar circuit model (Kobayashi et al. 2021), so I only provide the modified program. Please download the original model by the author's github (https://github.com/TairaKobayashi/Cerebellum-neuron-model-simulation-using-RKC) and replace the files. Note that the program "stdp.c" in chapter3-3 is independent from the cerebellar model and was used to generate stimulation values after learning.
