# Dicrimination-and-learning-of-temporal-input-sequences-in-a-cerebellar-Purkinje-cell-model

These programs were used in the article "Discrimination and learning of temporal input sequences in a cerebellar Purkinje cell model". 

In this research, we modified part of the cerebellar circuit model (Kobayashi et al. 2021), so we only provide the modified program. Please download the original model by the author's github (https://github.com/TairaKobayashi/Cerebellum-neuron-model-simulation-using-RKC) and replace the files. Note that the program "stdp.c" in chapter3-3 is independent from the cerebellar model and was used to generate stimulation values after learning.
